## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Through my reading of the problem, I found that there must be loop sentence and two condition so that we can solve the problem and add the number to the array and place it in the middle.
It took me about an hour to find a solution.
