# Challenge Summary

Trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Merge Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

## Test :

----
## Approach & Efficiency :
---
Time: O(n Log n) => quasilinear time

because merge sort always divides the array in two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves.

Space: O(n) => linear space

because we need to create new sub arrays to store elements.

## Solution :
